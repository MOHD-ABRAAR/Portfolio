IMPORTANT: To enable the "Customer Service & Incident Toolkit" link on the home page, please manually copy the file "Mohd_ISR_CustomerToolkit.zip.docx" from your Downloads folder into this directory (assets/downloads/).

Without the actual file present here, the link will not work and you will see a "File not available" error.

Once the file is placed here, the link on the home page will open or download the file as expected.
